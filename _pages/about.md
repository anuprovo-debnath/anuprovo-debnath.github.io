I’m Anuprovo, a third-year undergraduate at **IISER Kolkata**, majoring in **Physics** with minor in **Mathematics** and **Computer Science**.

My academic interests lie primarily in **plasma physics and nuclear fusion**, with a focus on **edge plasma-wall interactions** in magnetically confined plasma devices such as **tokamaks and stellarators**. I am particularly interested in understanding edge plasma dynamics, turbulence, and plasma-surface interactions -- key challenges that currently limit long-term stable magnetic confinement. I strongly believe that **nuclear fusion** holds promise as a major sustainable energy source in the long-term future.

My academic background and research experience are detailed in my [CV](/cv/) and [projects](/projects/) sections of this website. I also plan to upload **class notes** and write informal **blog** posts on topics I’m learning and exploring.

Outside academics, I enjoy playing guitar, reading books, and watching films. When not studying, I'm probably by the dimmer board in **RNT Auditorium** during a drama production, or tinkering with **computers in homelab** (inspired by [r/homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab)).
