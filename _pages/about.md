I am currently a third year undergraduate at IISER Kolkata with a deep enthusiasm for physics. I am interested to work in plasma physics and nuclear fusion, specially in the domain of magnetic confinement of fusion plasmas. I am also very interested in simulation and coding to solve various problems in physics.
